<p>The goal of flyxwyrk is to enable a new type of employment, one which gives both workers and the businesses which need them maximum flexibility. Let's say someone calls in sick and you need another cashier; there are cashiers from other
similar stores nearby who have the day off, and one or more might want some extra money. Or you are retired, but an unexpected expense came up, and you want to
work a few shifts to pay it off, with no long-term commitment.
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/jcomeauictx/flyxwyrk">code repository</a> will remain public as long as I (John Comeau &lt;jc@unternet.net&gt;) have any say in the matter.
